### Requirements:
 - Last node
 - Yarn
 - Docker

To run the project please do next steps:

### Run the server
1. Go to `server` folder: `cd server`
2. Run `docker compose up` command (**note:** sometimes single command doesn't works properly, solution - just run this command second time. It's required more time for investigation)
3. Server should start on `http://localhost:8877`

### Run the client
1. Go to `client` folder: `cd client`
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`
4. Client should work on `http://localhost:3000`


That's it!
